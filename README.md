# Angular Projects

1. ## Building an SPA Application with Scully and Angular Router

    In this project, we will build a personal blog using the Angular framework and enhance it with Jamstack characteristics using the Scully site generator. Initially, we will scaffold a new Angular application and enable it for routing. We will then create the basic layout of our application by adding some barebones components. As soon as we have a working Angular application, we will add blog support to it using Scully. We will then create some blog posts using Markdown files and display them on the home page of our application.
