# Angular Projects

1. ## Building an SPA Application with Scully and Angular Router

    In this project, we will build a personal blog using the Angular framework and enhance it with Jamstack characteristics using the Scully site generator. Initially, we will scaffold a new Angular application and enable it for routing. We will then create the basic layout of our application by adding some barebones components. As soon as we have a working Angular application, we will add blog support to it using Scully. We will then create some blog posts using Markdown files and display them on the home page of our application.

2. ## Building an SPA Application with Scully and Angular Router

    In this project, we will build an Angular application for managing and tracking issues using reactive forms and Clarity. Initially, we will display a list of issues in a table that we can sort and filter. We will then create a form for allowing users to report new issues. Finally, we will create a modal dialog for resolving an issue. We will also go the extra mile and turn on suggestions when reporting an issue to help users avoid duplicate entries.

3. ## Building a PWA Weather Application Using Angular Service Worker

    We can access a web application using different types of devices, such as a desktop, mobile, or tablet, and over various types of network, such as broadband, Wi-Fi, and cellular. A web application should work seamlessly and provide the same user experience independently of the device and the network of the user.

    Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are applications built with a collection of techniques with the previous considerations in mind. One popular technique is the service worker, which improves the loading time of a web application. In this chapter, we will use the service worker implemen- tation of the Angular framework to build a PWA that displays the weather of a city using the OpenWeather API.

    - Setting up the OpenWeather API
    - Displaying weather data
    - Enabling offline mode with the service worker
    - Staying up to date with in-app notifications
    - Deploying our app with Firebase Hosting
